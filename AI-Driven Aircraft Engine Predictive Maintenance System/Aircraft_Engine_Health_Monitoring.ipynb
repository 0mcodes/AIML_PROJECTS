    "Modern aircraft engines generate large volumes of sensor data during operation. Monitoring this data effectively is critical for ensuring engine reliability, reducing unplanned downtime, and enabling proactive maintenance decisions. Traditional reactive maintenance approaches can lead to increased operational costs and safety risks, making predictive maintenance a key focus area in the aerospace industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building an AI-driven predictive maintenance system for aircraft engines using historical sensor data. The objective is to analyze multivariate time-series data collected from aircraft engines and develop machine learning models that can estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an engine and detect early signs of abnormal behavior. By identifying degradation patterns before failure occurs, the system aims to support data-driven maintenance planning and risk mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project leverages the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine dataset, which contains run-to-failure sensor readings across multiple engine life cycles. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and result interpretation. In addition to predictive modeling, the project incorporates an explainability layer using GenAI concepts, enabling the generation of human-readable maintenance insights from model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates an end-to-end application of machine learning and AI techniques to a real-world aerospace engineering problem, highlighting skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and AI-assisted decision support."

    "Aircraft engines operate under complex and varying conditions and are subject to gradual degradation over time. Unplanned engine failures can lead to significant operational disruptions, increased maintenance costs, and potential safety risks. From a business perspective, aerospace organizations must balance engine reliability, maintenance efficiency, and cost control, while ensuring strict compliance with safety and regulatory standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional maintenance strategies are often reactive or schedule-based, relying on fixed inspection intervals or component lifetimes. These approaches may result in premature maintenance, unnecessary component replacement, or delayed detection of critical issues. As a result, there is a strong business need for predictive maintenance systems that can accurately assess engine health and forecast failure risk based on actual operating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an engineering standpoint, the challenge lies in analyzing high-dimensional, multivariate time-series sensor data collected across multiple engine life cycles. Each engine exhibits unique operational patterns, degradation rates, and noise characteristics, making it difficult to directly model failure behavior. Engineers must extract meaningful features, identify degradation trends, and distinguish between normal operational variability and true fault conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core engineering problem addressed in this project is to develop an AI-driven approach that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines based on historical sensor readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Detect early-stage anomalies that may indicate abnormal degradation or impending failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Provide interpretable insights that support maintenance decision-making rather than producing opaque predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By solving this problem, the system aims to support data-driven maintenance planning, reduce unplanned downtime, and improve overall operational efficiency, aligning both engineering objectives and business outcomes in the aerospace domain."
